# Week 04: Java Collections and Streams

Welcome to the repository for Week 4 of our Java learning journey. This week was focused on mastering the Java Collections Framework, understanding streams and input/output handling, and learning important Java 8 features like lambda expressions and functional interfaces. Exception handling, regular expressions, and testing with JUnit were also introduced.

## Overview

Week 4 deepened students' understanding of how to manage and manipulate data collections in Java. The Java Collections Framework was explored along with generics for type-safe data handling. The week also introduced I/O stream classes for reading and writing data, exception handling mechanisms, regular expressions, and unit testing with JUnit. Finally, Java 8 features were practiced including lambda expressions and the Stream API.
